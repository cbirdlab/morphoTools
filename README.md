# morphoTools
Tools for Tidy Morphological Data

This R package includes tools for morphological analysis and was inspired by the paper, Hamilton et al., 2020 (Journal of Biogeography, 47(7), pp.1494-1509).

## Installation

Install the latest version of this package by entering the following in R:

```R
# install.packages("devtools") # Uncomment and run if you don't have devtools installed
devtools::install_github("cbirdlab/morphoTools")
```

## Main Functionality

The package includes a function normalizeCharacter(), which normalizes a morphological character measurement (a column in your tibble) by another character, following an allometric scaling law.

```R

normalizeCharacter(data, "character_column", "normalize_by_column")
```

Where data is your data frame, "character_column" is the name of the column to be normalized, and "normalize_by_column" is the name of the column by which to normalize.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use normalizeCharacter():

```R
# Load the library
library(morphoTools)

# Create a sample data frame
data <- data.frame(width_cm = rnorm(100, 10, 2), length_cm = rnorm(100, 50, 10))

# Use the function
normalizeCharacter(data, "width_cm", "length_cm")
```
